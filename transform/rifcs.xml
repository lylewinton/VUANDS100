         <description type="brief">The data set collects brain size estimates in as many species of Anseriformes as possible to investigate the evolution of brain size in the group by using a comparative approach. Both wild and captive specimens were examined. The skeletal measurements were recorded in the Excel file, including several data fields such as brain cavity volume, average femur least diameter / circumference, average tibiotarsus least diameter / circumference, and average tarsus least diameter / circumference. The data collection was started in Nov 2003 and is still ongoing. The dataset 1 contains more than 1500 data records, some of which have been published in the related journals.

            <namePart>Using Knowledge Management techniques to assist with the analysis of decision-making by the Australian Football League Match Review Panel and the Australian Football League Tribunal</namePart>
         </name>
         <description type="brief">In September 2006, Prof. John Zeleznikow, Andrew Vincent and Brendon Stewart received a grant from the Australian Football league Research Board to undertake this project. The goal of the project was to examine issue of consistency and fairness in sporting tribunal decision-making. A more difficult issue is the role of consistency of decision-making and whether fairness automatically includes consistency given that each human event is unique in its facts. Should like be treated the same as (nearly) like or should each event be treated without reference to any other event? The AFL clearly wanted to increase consistency in the new system. (See ‘set of principles’ in AFL Tribunals Reforms 2005) yet does not accept the legal principle of precedent (the principle that the results of previous similar cases should influence or even direct the result of the instant case). This reflects the even present conflict in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making between flexibility and predictability.
This project was conducted in 2006.

For the 2005 season, the Australian Football League (AFL) overhauled its system of determining penalties for significant player infringements during a match. It introduced a Match Review Panel which was responsible for assessing and classifying incidents from all AFL matches. Whilst umpires could still report players, the match review panel was established to review the videos of each game . A pre-defined set of points was given for each infringement. Players with prior poor records (viewed as an aggravating factor) receive an increased penalty, while those who accept the view of the Match Review Panel (and the case is not heard by the Tribunal) receive a reduced penalty.

         <description type="brief">The interview was conducted in 2006 with several people in the Australian Football League (AFL) Match Review Panel and Tribunal process and explored the knowledge management techniques to assist with the analysis of decision-making by the AFL Match Review Panel and AFL Tribunal.

From the 2005 season, the Australian Football League (AFL) overhauled its system of determining penalties for significant player infringements during a match. It introduced a Match Review Panel which was responsible for assessing and classifying incidents from all AFL matches. The goal of this data collection is to examine issues of consistency and fairness in sporting tribunal / review panel decision-making.

The interview content was recorded in the Word file, together with the brief project introduction and timeline.

         </name>
         <description type="brief">This project examines how women overcome societal, organisational and familial barriers to become elite level coaches, officials and administrators in Australia. The research also explores potential and perceived barriers to achieving sport leadership and the success stories of women who have gained leadership positions. It is hoped that through this research awareness of the factors creating barriers will lead to the development of ways for Victorian / Australian organisations to assist the advancement of women in leadership positions.

         </name>
         <description type="brief">This data set contains representation information on women coaches and administrators from selected sport organisations and boards in the sports of athletics, basketball, football (soccer) and swimming. Data collection was based on annual snapshots taken in July/August of 2010 and 2011. The data was newly created / collated in Excel or PDF format, being sourced from individual internet websites belonging to Australian / international sports organisations and governing boards. Data was entered as total count for the number of people, in a given position, for each gender. The names of the individuals were not recorded. This research is related to \'sport psychology\', \'sport management\', \'leadership\' and \'gender equity\'.

\"Leadership\" here encompasses coaches, administrators (both of sport organisations and their governing boards) and officials (referees, judges, etc.). \"Elite sport\" here refers to competition at the state/territory level or higher, through to international competition.

            <namePart>Catchment level downscaling of hydroclimatic variables from general circulation model outputs</namePart>
         </name>
         <description type="brief">Due to the recent Millennium drought in Victoria, Grampian-Wimmera-Mallee water supply system in north western Victoria experienced a large drop in inflows to its reservoirs. As a solution, the inefficient open channel transmission network it had previously, has been replaced with a pipeline. Due to this system reconfiguration, it is in need of a revised set of daily operating rules. Developments of daily optimized operating rules require daily hydro-climatic data accounting for climate change.

The aim of this research is projecting daily and monthly streamflows, precipitation, temperature and evaporation, from outputs of several General Circulation Models at catchment scale. Monthly GCM outputs are downscaled statistically to catchment scale with Support Vector Machine and Multi-linear Regression.

This is the first hydroclimatic variable downscaling attempt over the Grampian-Wimmera-Mallee water supply system. The research employs downscaling models based on 12 calendar months enabling a better capture of hydroclimatic variables.

         <description type="brief">The omnium is a newly introduced track cycling competition to be included in the London 2012 Olympic Games. It involves six individual events and, therefore, requires strategic planning for riders and coaches to achieve the best overall standing in terms of the ranking, speed, and time in each individual component.

The goal of the project was to identify winning performance patterns of riders in the omnium based on the performance results. The unsupervised, supervised, and statistical analyses have been conducted on the men’s and women’s historical competition data in the World Championships since 2008 to find winning patterns for each gender in terms of the ranking of riders in each individual event.

The project was started in January 2010 and is ongoing.

         <description type="brief">Lewis &amp; Skinner was a Melbourne-based signwriting company operating from the early 1900s until the 1950s. The company\'s records were found dumped at a Footscray demolition site in February 2012 by Dr Stefan Schutt from Victoria University, whose workplace was next door. Dr Schutt removed as many of the records as possible, and created a project to scan and upload the records to an online archive system based on the Omeka open source archive software. The documents, photos and drawings tell the story of signwriting jobs across Melbourne and Victoria, from Mobil service stations to milk bars and railway hoardings. Most are from the 1950s though there are also earlier ones. The records are organised by suburb and tagged by theme. They also contain geolocation information wherever possible.

Includes records of commissions undertaken on walls, hoardings, shop fronts, milk bars and service stations for the Vacuum Oil Company (Mobil Oil), Robur Tea, Cadburys Chocolate, Groves McVitty (Medallion Shoe Polish), BALM Paints (Dulux), Swallows &amp; Ariell, International Harvester, Richmond Brewery, Caltex, Ansett, Myer, Noon Pies, Taumans Paints, Rosella Fods and Francis Longmore (White Crow Tomato Sauce). Most records are from 1948 to 1956, although there are some dating back to the 1920s. Records have been scanned in jpeg image format and organised by suburb and area using a  customised version of the Omeka archival web system. They have also been tagged thematically and have geolocation information added wherever possible. Scanning and uploading is continuing.

         <description type="brief">There has been a library on the Footscray Park campus site since a Mechanics Institute was established there in 1916. Individual items and formed collections of value to researchers have been acquired or donated to the Library since this time. These items form the basis of the VU Library Special Collections. The VU Library Special Collections contain books, journals and pamphlets of research value on a diverse range of subjects but the predominant categories are Australian Literature, Australian History, Australian Folklore, and Left-wing politics and literature in Australia and Overseas. The VU Library Special Collections are located in the Special Collections Room, P402, at the Footscray Park Campus Library of Victoria University.
Historical material about Footscray Technical College, Footscray Technical School, Footscray Institute of Technology (FIT), Western Melbourne Institute of TAFE (WMIT) or the Western Institute is held by the University Archives and is not in the VU Library Special Collections.

         <description type="brief">Based around left-wing politics and town planning issues this collection of published material and working papers constitutes an important basis for understanding the wide variety of causes with which the Crows were associated - from Ruth\'s work with women and children in Brunswick during WWII, and Maurie\'s in the Clerk\'s Union, to the pioneering work they did from the 1960\'s onwards in relation to public participation in urban planning, building neighbourhood communities and creating a sustainable future. Many of the publications of Ruth and Maurie Crow were digitised in the 2011 ASHER funded Crow Papers Digitisation Project: http://vuir.vu.edu.au/view/subjects/crow.html

         <description type="brief">Based around left-wing politics and town planning issues this collection of pamphlets constitutes an important basis for understanding the wide variety of causes with which the Crows were associated - from Ruth\'s work with women and children in Brunswick during WWII, and Maurie\'s in the Clerk\'s Union, to the pioneering work they did from the 1960\'s onwards in relation to public participation in urban planning, building neighbourhood communities and creating a sustainable future. Many of the publications of Ruth and Maurie Crow were digitised in the 2011 ASHER funded Crow Papers Digitisation Project: http://vuir.vu.edu.au/view/subjects/crow.html

         <description type="brief">The data set collects brain size estimates in as many species of Anseriformes as possible to investigate the evolution of brain size in the group by using a comparative approach. Both wild and captive specimens were examined. The skeletal measurements were recorded in the Excel file, including several data fields such as brain cavity volume, average femur least diameter / circumference, average tibiotarsus least diameter / circumference, and average tarsus least diameter / circumference. The data collection was started in Nov 2003 and is still ongoing. The dataset 2 contains nearly 400 data records which has not been published to the public yet.

         <description type="brief">There has been a library on the Footscray Park campus site since a Mechanics Institute was established there in 1916. Individual items and formed collections of value to researchers have been acquired or donated to the Library since this time. These items form the basis of the VU Library Special Collections. The VU Library Special Collections contain books, journals and pamphlets of research value on a diverse range of subjects but the predominant categories are Australian Literature, Australian History, Australian Folklore, and Left-wing politics and literature in Australia and Overseas. The VU Library Special Collections are located in the Special Collections Room, P402, at the Footscray Park Campus Library of Victoria University.
Historical material about Footscray Technical College, Footscray Technical School, Footscray Institute of Technology (FIT), Western Melbourne Institute of TAFE (WMIT) or the Western Institute is held by the University Archives and is not in the VU Library Special Collections.

         <description type="brief">Gary Foley (b 1950) Born in Grafton, northern NSW, of Gumbainggir descent.

He spent most of his youth in Nambucca Heads. Expelled from school at the age of 15, Foley came to Sydney as a 17-year-old apprentice draughts person. Since then he has been at the centre of major political activities including the 1971 Springbok tour demonstrations, the Tent Embassy in Canberra in 1972, the Commonwealth Games protest in 1982, and more recently, the protests during the 1988 bicentennial celebrations.

He was also involved in the formation of Redfern\'s Aboriginal Legal Service (in Sydney) and the Aboriginal Medical Service in Melbourne. In 1974 Foley was part of an Aboriginal delegation that toured China and in 1978 he was with a group that took films on black Australia to the Cannes Film festival and then to Germany and other European countries. He returned to England and Europe a year later and set up the first Aboriginal Information Centre in London. Foley has been a director of the Aboriginal Health Service (1981) and the Director of the Aboriginal Arts Board (1983-86) and the Aboriginal Medical Service Redfern (1988). He has been a senior lecturer at Swinburne College in Melbourne, consultant to the Royal Commission into Black Deaths in Custody (1988) and a board member of the Aboriginal Legal Service. He has also served on the national executive of the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations.

His acting career began in 1972 with the revue Basically Black. Since then he has appeared in Backroads, Going Down, Buckeye &amp; Pinto, Pandemonium, Dogs in Space, Flying Doctors and A Country Practice.

Late in life Foley became a student at University of Melbourne where he studied history, cultural studies and computer science. He completed his BA with majors in History and Cultural Studies in 2000, and gained first class Honours in History at the end of 2002. Between 2001 and April 2005 he was also the Senior Curator for Southeastern Australia at Museum Victoria. Between 2005 and 2008 he was a lecturer / tutor in the Education Faculty of University of Melbourne, and has completed a PhD in History at the Australian Centre at University of Melbourne.  Gary is now a lecturer at Moondani Balluk Victoria University.

         <description type="brief">The Rationalist Society of Australia (RSA) has been influential in its involvement in the religious and political debates in Australian society. The RSA was formed in Melbourne in the 1926. To support the work of the RSA John Langley established the Rationalist Library in 1934.  An important member of the RSA executive in the 1930\'s and 1940\'s was William Glanville Cook. After his death in 1984 his personal collection of books was bequeathed to the Rationalist Library.

In 2002, Victoria University Library agreed to accept the Rationalist Society of Australia Library as one of its research collections and house it at the Footscray Park Campus. This collection of books, journals and pamphlets is now called the Rationalist Collection and is located in the Library\'s Special Collections Room, P402, at Footscray Park Campus of Victoria University.

         <description type="brief">In 1992, a project was established to record oral history interviews with key members of the then newly created Victoria University of Technology (VUT). All interviews were conducted by Howard Dosser, Secretary and Registrar of VUT. 

Interviews were conducted with university leaders, including Vice Chancellors and Pro Vice Chancellors, members of the VUT Council, foundation professors of the University, directors of departments, and staff from Victorian Government agencies, including the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission (VPSEC). 

Interviewees were invited to reflect on the beginnings of VUT; positives and negatives coming out of the merger between Footscray Institute of Technology and the Western Institute; the place of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (which pulled out of the proposed merger in 1991); issues surrounding the university as a dual-sector institution; and the future of VUT. 

The interviews were originally recorded onto reel to reel tapes, and dubbed onto cassette. A digitisation project in March 2012 created digital copies, in .mp3 and .aur formats. Each interview is between 35 - 50 minutes long.

            <namePart>Oral history recordings and transcripts - Sir Zelman Cowen in conversation with Don Markwell</namePart>
         </name>
         <description type="brief">This series consists of a number of conversations and interviews held between Sir Zelman Cowen and Professor Don Markwell (and occasionally others) in 1996. Topics covered include Cowen’s childhood and upbringing, experiences during World War II, his family and relationships, experiences at Oxford and the teaching of Law generally, Jewish identity and experiences as the Governor-General. 

Other participants in some conversations include Dr Robin Sharwood, Geoffrey Browne, David Butler, Professor John McLaren and Dr Dennis Glover. 

Transcripts were also created soon after the recordings were made, and edited transcripts exist for all interviews. Not all recordings of the interviews are extant and it seems that some were sent out for review in 1996 and were never returned. A digitisation project in March 2012 created digital copies, in .mp3 and .aur formats, of those tapes present.

         <description type="brief">This collection contains copies of Overland Literary Journal, a radical left-wing literary and cultural magazine. The journal is published quarterly and includes commentary on current affairs, fiction poetry and prose, artwork and reviews. Most articles have a political or cultural focus. 

While Overland was established in 1954, this collection contains copies of the journal since Victoria University began providing support for it in 1997. New copies of the journal are forwarded to the Archives as part of the distribution process. 

If you are looking for back issues of Overland prior to 1997, it is advised that you contact the journal direct.

         <description type="brief">Sport and Recreation Spatial is a collaborative project between Centre for eCommerce and Communications (CeCC) and the School of Health Sciences at the University of Ballarat, in partnership with the Australian Sports Commission, Victoria University and VicHealth, which involves the development of a spatial ICT system of sporting and recreation data, and is gaining much interest from peak sporting organisations in Australia.

The Sport and Recreation Spatial project, which is being lead by Dr Rochelle Eime, joint VicHealth Research Practice Fellow (Physical Activity) at Victoria University and the University of Ballarat, provides a national system for presenting spatial data about the sports industry. The project is also being supported by researchers Dr Jack Harvey and Dr Neroli Sawyer. Through the development of a sport and recreation spatial ICT system – tailored specifically for this project by CeCC – national and state-specific data (including national survey data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; data from the Exercise Recreation and Sport Survey, ERASS; Victorian sport and recreation facility data; Victorian State Sporting Associations membership data) can be mapped and statistically manipulated to gain a greater understanding of sport and recreational participation across Australia.

The spatial ICT system has wide application and appeal. Not only will it have the potential to offer a greater understanding of the current sport and recreation industry in Australia, but it will provide the industry with evidence to make informed decisions to systematically grow their sport participation in the future. In addition, Sport and Recreation Spatial will provide the capacity to investigate the ‘value of sport’ in terms of participatory health benefits via access to national health and well being measures. It is anticipated that the spatial ICT system will facilitate new research initiatives around the health/wellbeing benefits of sport participation at a community, state and national level.  The data system is set for launch in August 2013.

In addition, Sport and Recreation Spatial will provide the capacity to investigate the ‘value of sport’ in terms of participatory health benefits via access to national health and well being measures. It is anticipated that the spatial ICT system will facilitate new research initiatives around the health/wellbeing benefits of sport participation at a community, state and national level.  The data system is set for launch in August 2013.

         <description type="brief">Sport and Recreation Spatial is a collaborative project between Centre for eCommerce and Communications (CeCC) and the School of Health Sciences at the University of Ballarat, in partnership with the Australian Sports Commission, Victoria University and VicHealth, which involves the development of a spatial ICT system of sporting and recreation data, and is gaining much interest from peak sporting organisations in Australia.

The Sport and Recreation Spatial project, which is being lead by Dr Rochelle Eime, joint VicHealth Research Practice Fellow (Physical Activity) at Victoria University and the University of Ballarat, provides a national system for presenting spatial data about the sports industry. The project is also being supported by researchers Dr Jack Harvey and Dr Neroli Sawyer. Through the development of a sport and recreation spatial ICT system – tailored specifically for this project by CeCC – national and state-specific data (including national survey data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; data from the Exercise Recreation and Sport Survey, ERASS; Victorian sport and recreation facility data; Victorian State Sporting Associations membership data) can be mapped and statistically manipulated to gain a greater understanding of sport and recreational participation across Australia.

The spatial ICT system has wide application and appeal. Not only will it have the potential to offer a greater understanding of the current sport and recreation industry in Australia, but it will provide the industry with evidence to make informed decisions to systematically grow their sport participation in the future. In addition, Sport and Recreation Spatial will provide the capacity to investigate the ‘value of sport’ in terms of participatory health benefits via access to national health and well being measures. It is anticipated that the spatial ICT system will facilitate new research initiatives around the health/wellbeing benefits of sport participation at a community, state and national level.  The data system is set for launch in August 2013.

         <description type="brief">Sport and Recreation Spatial is a collaborative project between Centre for eCommerce and Communications (CeCC) and the School of Health Sciences at the University of Ballarat, in partnership with the Australian Sports Commission, Victoria University and VicHealth, which involves the development of a spatial ICT system of sporting and recreation data, and is gaining much interest from peak sporting organisations in Australia.

The Sport and Recreation Spatial project, which is being lead by Dr Rochelle Eime, joint VicHealth Research Practice Fellow (Physical Activity) at Victoria University and the University of Ballarat, provides a national system for presenting spatial data about the sports industry. The project is also being supported by researchers Dr Jack Harvey and Dr Neroli Sawyer. Through the development of a sport and recreation spatial ICT system – tailored specifically for this project by CeCC – national and state-specific data (including national survey data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics; data from the Exercise Recreation and Sport Survey, ERASS; Victorian sport and recreation facility data; Victorian State Sporting Associations membership data) can be mapped and statistically manipulated to gain a greater understanding of sport and recreational participation across Australia.

The spatial ICT system has wide application and appeal. Not only will it have the potential to offer a greater understanding of the current sport and recreation industry in Australia, but it will provide the industry with evidence to make informed decisions to systematically grow their sport participation in the future. In addition, Sport and Recreation Spatial will provide the capacity to investigate the ‘value of sport’ in terms of participatory health benefits via access to national health and well being measures. It is anticipated that the spatial ICT system will facilitate new research initiatives around the health/wellbeing benefits of sport participation at a community, state and national level.  The data system is set for launch in August 2013.

            <namePart>The Effect of the Flow of Knowledge and Collective Intelligence on Three Centuries of Development of Bushehr</namePart>
         </name>
         <description type="brief">The forces of globalization and developments in information technology are leading to the ready access to, and a democratization of knowledge. This is reflected in the design of urban spaces that draw on the capabilities of a collective intelligence. Before the emergence of globalization the flow of information and knowledge were much slower, and it occurred mainly as a result of trade and military conquests. There have been some cities in the world that formed communications hubs. Many of these cities were located in coastal areas which naturally led them to be a source and repository of knowledge of itinerants from the known world. One of these locations is the old city of Bushehr. Bushehr grew in importance about three centuries ago as one of principal trading ports in the Persian Gulf, and it has successively been a naval base used by the East India Company and the British navy from the early eighteenth century until the twentieth century. Because of the strong maritime links between Bushehr and the west coast of India, the east coast of Africa and Iran’s mainland specific types of urban spaces formed in this area which was affected strongly by flow of knowledge between these regions. Bushehr’s design is based on a collective intelligence. This project traces this flow of knowledge and the role that collective intelligence had in the development of the old town of Bushehr. It shows how urban design benefits from communication and circulation of knowledge that ultimately results in an environmentally sustainable design. The project also demonstrates an analogy between traditional forms and contemporary forms of knowledge that can lead to creation of an ecocity.

         <description type="brief">This project focuses on using statistical and machine learning techniques for analyzing triathlon performance data with the aim of understanding medaling patterns. Triathlon is a high profile multi-component sport which requires strategic understanding and planning with respect to each of the three sports involved, i.e., swimming, cycling, and running, to achieve the best overall standing. We use correlation measures, data summarization, and probabilistic modeling on triathlon historical data since 1989 to:
i) investigate which component (swimming, cycling, or running) has the greatest contribution to the overall ranking of male and female triathletes,
ii) what minimum time gap behind the lead athlete (for each component) may still retain a high likelihood of medaling, and
iii) model triathlon performances for future decision making.

         <description type="brief">The dataset includes World Championship, World Cup, and Olympic Games competition results collected from the International Triathlon Union\'s website. This includes all the results available for the ITU\'s championships since 1989 for both men and women. The dataset initially consisted of raw time measures for each component as well as the two transitions for the top 20 triathletes in each competition in the form of competition, year, final standing, overall time, swimming time, transition 1 time, cycling time, transition 2 time, and running time. We have performed pre-processing on the raw data and now it includes time differences (compared with the lead athlete) in each component. The data collection is stored in the CSV format.
