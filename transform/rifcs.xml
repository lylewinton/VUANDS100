         <description type="brief">The data set collects brain size estimates in as many species of Anseriformes as possible to investigate the evolution of brain size in the group by using a comparative approach. Both wild and captive specimens were examined. The skeletal measurements were recorded in the Excel file, including several data fields such as brain cavity volume, average femur least diameter / circumference, average tibiotarsus least diameter / circumference, and average tarsus least diameter / circumference. The data collection was started in Nov 2003 and is still ongoing. The dataset 1 contains more than 1500 data records, some of which have been published in the related journals.

         <description type="brief">The omnium is a newly introduced track cycling competition to be included in the London 2012 Olympic Games. It involves six individual events and, therefore, requires strategic planning for riders and coaches to achieve the best overall standing in terms of the ranking, speed, and time in each individual component.

The goal of the project was to identifiy winning performance patterns of riders in the omnium based on the performance results. The unsupervised, supervised, and statistical analyses have been conducted on the men’s and women’s historical competition data in the World Championships since 2008 to find winning patterns for each gender in terms of the ranking of riders in each individual event.

The project was started in January 2010 and is ongoing.</description>
