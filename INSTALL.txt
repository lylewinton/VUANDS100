
=== PREREQUISITES ===

1. An AAF account for access to NeCTAR.
2. A public SSH key imported into your NeCTAR account, or a created keypair with the
  downloaded key setup for SSH access.
3. A NeCTAR Security Group (eg. default) configured to allow access to ports 80 (HTTP) and 22 (SSH).
4. A dynamic domain name with username and password, www.dnsdynamic.org recommended.  [optional]



=== INSTALLATION NOTES ===

* Login to the NECTAR Dashboard using you AAF credentials.
https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/nova/

* Search for the appropriate base image under the "Images & Snapshots" section, eg. VU-ANDS-base20121019

* Launch the approriate image, a small flavor is sufficient, remember to select your keypair
and the right secuirty group.

You'll need to provide 5 lines of "User Data" to start the image.  The first line is a
hostname for dynamic DNS, or start with a hash for none.  Next 2 lines are username and
password for dynamic DNS, provide dummy values if you have none.  The 4th line is the
(non-root) username and password that WordPress will use to connect to the database, your choice.

* Configure WordPress's new URL by loggin in as administrator.  You must directly access the login
URL then directly access the Settings/General URL.  Example IP address used below.
NOTE:  Use direct URLs only!  Or the site will forward you to the wrong (configured) URL.

Login:
http://115.146.95.168/ands2/wp-login.php
Username:  admin
Password:  Xy4SE9TP2sQT
Settings/General:
http://115.146.95.168/ands2/wp-admin/options-general.php

* Update the post-registration URL...
http://115.146.95.168/ands2/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=wplogin_redirect.php

* Update the "Login with Ajax" global logout redirect URL...
http://115.146.95.168/ands2/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=login-with-ajax



=== SECURING THE INSTANCE ===

Remove any old SSH key lines from /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys , but be sure to leave your own.
   $  ssh ubuntu@115.146.95.168
   $  pico /home/ubuntu/.ssh/authorized_keys

Change the root password of the MySQL database server.
   $  ssh ubuntu@115.146.95.168
   $  mysqladmin -u root -pmypassword123 password "NewPassword"
   $  pico /home/ubunut/root
   ### modify any references to the old root password

Using the phpMyAdmin interface to MySQL drop any unused database users:
   http://115.146.95.168/phpmyadmin/
   localhost
   Privileges
   (select unwanted users, especially those where Host=%)
   Remove selected users (section) -> Go

Login via WordPress and change the "admin" account's password.
   http://115.146.95.168/ands2/wp-admin/
   Username:  admin
   Password:  Xy4SE9TP2sQT

Remove any old Formidable/Form-Entries from the WordPress admin menu.
Note:  Once a form-entry owner (User ID) is deleted the entry is harder to access.

Remove any old Users from the WordPress admin menu.  Be sure to leave "admin".



=== CUSTOMISING THE INSTANCE ===

In WordPress you should customise the look and feel of the site...

Settings > General   - Site Title, Tagline, E-mail Address

Formidable > Forms > ANDS v100 > Settings > Email  - Modify email addresses in the settings.

Formidable > Forms > ANDS v100 > Edit  - Modify the default copyright statement.

Appearance > Header  - Select a new header image

Appearance > Theme   - Changing theme is possible but requires browser testing.  Graphene works best with the VU SOE.

Appearance > Menu    - Change "Main Menu" if required.

Pages > All Pages    - You'll need to customise text in Home, About RDA.

Posts > All Posts    - Posts aren't really used, but if you start using them you should modify existing entries.
