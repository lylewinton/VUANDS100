
=== INSTALLATION ===

The build guide is designed to provide further documentation on how to build the website server
from scratch, but does not cover the site content or building the ANDS form.

We recommend you use the INSTALL guide, starting with a NeCTAR image... much faster!
eg. VU-ANDS-base20121019

The build guide also includes technical notes on how the metadata transform to RIF-CS works,
further below.



=== SERVER BUILD NOTES ===

The system was started from the NeCTAR cloud "InstantWeb" image.  Further details:
http://support.rc.nectar.org.au/docs/image_catalog.html
Essentially this is an ubuntu image with wordpress, mediawiki, phpmyadmin, mysql installed

(NOTE: This instance is now deprecated.)

Fix the hostname...

$  sudo hostname MYHOSTNAME.DOMAIN
$  sudo vi /etc/hostname
$  sudo vi /etc/hosts

Sendmail is required for new account verification.  Install and check running on port 25 (local access only)...

$  sudo apt-get install sendmail
$ chmod go-w /etc
$ chmod go-w /etc/mail
$  sudo /etc/init.d/sendmail stop
$  sudo /etc/init.d/sendmail start
$  sudo lsof -i

(Optional) DynamicDNS install (ddclient) and edit the config /etc/ddclient.conf
$  sudo apt-get install ddclient


Configure WordPress...

$  cd /var/www/wordpress/
$  sudo touch .htaccess
$  sudo chgrp www-data .htaccess
$  sudo chmod g+w .htaccess
$  sudo chown -R www-data:www-data *
$  sudo chmod -R g+w wp-content

$  sudo vi /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default 
### change /var/www "AllowOverride None" to...
AllowOverride All

$  sudo vi /etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
### increase post max size for Formidable
post_max_size = 64M
### add max_input_vars to the bottom for Formidable, required for PHP versions before 5.3.9
add max_input_vars=2000

$  sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

$  sudo vi /var/www/wordpress/wp-config.php
### Add lines to allow simple installation of plugins
define( 'FS_METHOD', 'direct' );
define( 'FS_CHMOD_DIR', 0777 );
define( 'FS_CHMOD_FILE', 0777 );
### add to the end, allows easier hostname changes in general settings
define('RELOCATE',true);


Configure the WordPress installation online...

Tips for form building...
* Be sure to set an email notification for form submission:
   Formidable > Forms > "FORM_NAME" > Settings > Email
* Be sure to check the security on the form:
   Formidable > Forms > ANDS v100 > Settings > General
   recommend Only logged-in users can see and submit this Form
   recommend Allow Logged-in Users to Edit Their Own Previous Responses

  CUSTOMISING THE INSTANCE

Talk with NeCTAR about the best way to maintain OS security patches for the server.



=== TRANSFORM NOTES ===

The Operator Guide explains how to extract Formidable form key-value pairs in XML format,
using the phpMyAdmin interface to the MySQL database.  An XSLT transform (transform.xml)
is then use to transform this XML format, together with an XML file of external organisation
details, into the RIF-CS XML format.

The External.xml file is generated from a MS Excel spreadsheet found in the folder static_files.
_READ_ME.txt in that folder has further information.  These are external organisations not already in
Research Data Australia that we will create records for.  The Excel file (XLSX) was modified
by mapping the spreadsheet columns to the XML Schema Source "VU_Org_Template.xsd".  The linking key
for each entry is the ID column.  Changing the ID will effect the ANDS registry URL for the
organisations, so avoid.  Changing the display name is fine.

The XSLT transform use "Saxon - XSLT and XQuery processor (Home Edition)" bundled
with this repository.  http://sourceforge.net/projects/saxon/files/Saxon-HE/9.4/
