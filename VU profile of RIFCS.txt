
Notes on the VU profile of the ANDS RIFCS model:


Project (RIF-CS Activity) - 1 per form
  * rules:  Project of the same name are considered duplicates, to be removed in XSLT.  So multiple datasets per project require multiple forms, and form review must check project names exactly match.


Collection - 1 per form
  * rule: Collection ID (handle, DOI etc) are provided as additional identifier.


Person (RIF-CS Party) - up to 5 per form
 + Internal ID (= email address)
 * rules:  First "contact" is project relationship "owner"/"manager" and collection relationship "manager".  Other contacts are project "related" and collection "related"
 * rules: Each external person has 1 primary organisation.
 * rules: If external person has an ANDS key (existing record), we link to that.


External Organisations (RIF-CS Party) - populated from static files, per Person
 + Name
 - Faculty
 + Description
 + URL
 + Contact text (address, phone, whatever)
 * rules: If external organisation has an ANDS key (existing record), we link to that.
 * rules: Externals are kept in a static file containing only organisations for which we maintain the details.
 * registryObject “group” attribute for all VU entries are "Victoria University".  However, for external orgs and people this is set to the external organisation name (in Externals.xml this is actually Department>Faculty)


Identifiers and Keys:
Initially were using manually created handles from ANDS webapp as "key" IDs for all records.  Requires a lot of manual entry, cutting and pasting, and the handles are unlikely to be used for external systems.
This change to generating local ID "key" for each entry (eg. like Giffith and others) and allow for
a handle/doi to  be added to the Collection.  Note that this is not the publication DOIs but is for
the data reference/citation itself.
* Keys:
 * Org Units:  vu.edu.au/org-<name of org unit>
   * ideally:  vu.edu.au/org-HASH(<name of org unit>)
 * Person:  vu.edu.au/person-<email>
   * ideally:  vu.edu.au/person-HASH(<email>)
 * Project:  vu.edu.au/project-<wp_frm_items.id? wp_frm_items.item_key?>
   * NOTE: changed to include "name" so ANDS ignores duplicate keys
 * Collection:  vu.edu.au/collection-<wp_frm_items.id? wp_frm_items.item_key?>
