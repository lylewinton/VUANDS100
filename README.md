VUANDS100
=========

Victoria University ANDS SC25 project.  This project developed a system for online collection of dataset/collection metadata and upload to Research Data Australia.


Getting Started
===============

Read the following files:

* *INSTALL.txt*
    * Instructions for getting your own image started on the NeCTAR cloud.

* *Service Manual - generic.docx*
    * A process you might implement in the collection, review, upload of records to RDA.

This system depends on an installation of WordPress (3.4) and the plugin Formidable Pro (1.06).  The install instructions depend on access to the [Australian NeCTAR research cloud](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/) where a public base image is available.
