=========

Victoria University ANDS SC25 project.  This project developed an interface, a website,
for the online collection of metadata describing research datasets and collection.
The metadata is collected via a single dynamic web form designed with field for upload into
the Research Data Australia registry
(in [RIF-CS](http://www.ands.org.au/resource/rif-cs.html) format).
The interface is hosted on a WordPress install and the form on the Formidable Pro pluggin.

This repository holds: instructions for creating and operating your own interface/site on the Australian
NeCTAR research cloud, based on an existing image; an export of the Formidable form used (for DIY installs);
and the files necessary for metadata conversion into RIF-CS for upload.

Getting Started
===============

Read the following files:

* *INSTALL.txt*
    * Instructions for getting your own image started on the NeCTAR cloud.

* *Service Manual - generic.docx*
    * An operational process you might implement in the collection, review, upload of records to RDA.

This system depends on an installation of WordPress (3.4) and the plugin Formidable Pro (1.06).
The install instructions depend on access to the
[Australian NeCTAR research cloud](https://dashboard.rc.nectar.org.au/)
where a public base image is available.
